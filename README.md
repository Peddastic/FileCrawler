FileCrawler
===========

Creates a mirror of the content of a directory. 
Used to save content of an external hard drive on your main drive.

It opens a simple command line window.
First you choose the directory you want to crawl.
Then the directory where you want to save the mirrored data.
The last input is the name you want to give to the directory that will be created.
The program then crawls through the chosen directory and creates a file 
with the same name and size zero into your destination directory.

This way the source and destination directory have the same structure.
This image of you e.g. hard drive can be saved on your internal drive,
so you can keep track of the contents on your hard drive without conecting
your hard drive to your system.
